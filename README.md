Building WikiStack
We are going to build our own little Wikipedia using all the tools we have learned so far for web development: Node, Express.js and MongoDB using Mongoose.

What is WikiStack?
Before we continue, let's define what WikiStack is. We are going to be building a Wiki-like web application that will have the following features:

Have a homepage that lists all the pages in our Wiki
We will be able to create new pages, and write to them with Markdown using the marked module.
Anyone will be able to edit pages (no login required)
We will be able to search for pages
Bonus: Keep a version history to each Page
Bonus: Discussion tab on each page
